        </p>
        <h1>2. Place the "Stage" folder into the Root folder</h1>

                <li>The second table decides on which enemy is being thrown into the randomize list.<br>
                For example, when Goomba, Koopa and Bob-omb is added, the randomizer will find any of those 3.<br>
                Once found, they will be changed to either one of the three enemies.</li>
            </ul>
            Select the item in the dropdown menu, and click "Add" to add to the list.
            Click "Remove" to remove the selected item from the rightside list.<br><br>
