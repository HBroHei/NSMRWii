# NSMRWii
 A general New Super Mario Bros Wii Randomizer\
 Currently the project is a work-in-progress.

## Usage
 A very temporary documentation about how to use this.
 1. Place the "Stage" folder at the root directory
 2. Compile randomize_basic.py

## Notes
 Although this project was not based on the Reggie! NSMBW level editor,
 Some U8 / Level data phrasing procedure were written with the help from the source code of the Reggie! Editor. \
 ***Due to an upcoming IRL event, updates to this project will be slowed down or paused at times until Late May***
