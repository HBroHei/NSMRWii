                A New Super Mario Bros. Wii Randomizer that can randomize enemies, levels and more!<br>
                Below is a large piece of text that descripe the process of the project. Be prepared.
            </p>
            <h1>The inspiration</h1>
            <p>
                When I first disovered the <a href="https://authorblues.github.io/smwrandomizer/">Super Mario World Randomizer</a>, I always
                though that was pretty cool concept.
                The randomizer offers a different enought experiece for players to experience the game again, and to me,
                this is what I value for a game.
                <br>
                Fast-forward to today, a lot of games still doesn't have a flesh-out randomizer, including one of my childhood game,
                New Super Mario Bros Wii. There are a level randomizer (which randomize the files), but not all the other things. Therefore,
                I decided to take on this project for 1, me, and 2, for other NSMBW fans.<br>
                Although I missed the "golden era" of NSMBW (Mainly because I fully understand the modding scene only a few years back, like 2017), I still wish to work on
                this project to increase my experience in programming (This is one of my first actual "big" project since I learnt programming) and
                also gain knowledge in game modding.

            <h1>How I got started</h1>
            <p>
                At the time I was already familar with Wii modding scene enough to know for how this project will be going.
                Here is a list of them:
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Item</th><th>Approach</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Programming language</td>
                        <td>Python</td>
                        <td>Can we just talk about how much more convenient Python is, compared to something like Java and C?<br>
                        Although, I have only learnt Python for a few months. (but I have been learning programming for 6 years!)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Oprating System</td>
                        <td>Web (JSON Generator)<br>Win/MacOS/Linux/whatever OS that can run Python locally(Randomizer)</td>
                        <td>I still wish to make it an executable (.exe)(mainly I have no experience in this subject), but the Batch script should be sufficent for now</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>User Interface</td>
                        <td>GUI (JSON Generator)<br>CLI (Randomizer)</td>
                        <td>I wish I could make the program GUI in clients' end (the actual Python script), but I will need to learn how to make a GUI application for Python first.<Br>
                        In the mean time, since I am familar with HTML, CSS and JS, I will use that as the GUI platform.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>File format reference</td>
                        <td><a href="https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/U8_(File_Format)">Custom Mario Kart Wiki</a> and<br><a href="https://www.github.com/CLF78/Reggie-Next">Reggie! Level editor</a></td>
                        <td>Shout out to the modders out there that "decode" how the file format works, I would not have known how it works otherwise.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h1>How the program works</h1>
            <span style="background-color: gold;">For a more detailed guide on how to use the randomizer, see <a href="https://hbrohei.github.io/NSMRWii/generator/tut.html">this guide</a></span>
            <p>
                First, the program would make a backup of all the files so that datas will not be lost during editing. It will also read the configuration file.<br>
                Second, the program would start processing each files.<br>
                The program would first process the levels in th "Skip Level" Section.<br>
                Then it would randomize the levels according to their groups order. That is, the group in front would be processed first.<br>
                Finally, it would process the levels by the file name in asending order.<br>
                During the level randomization process, other level modiications would be made, such as enemy randomization, to reduce the iteration times.<br><br>
                The randomized levels would be in the "Stage_Shuffled" folder.
            </p>

            <h1>Updates</h1>
            <p>
                One step at a time is always a good thing, especially when there is no time pressure. That's why I have been rolling out updates to this project.<br>
                Having updates also means that bugs can be traced more easily, unlike developing all the thing at once.<br>
                Here is a list of updates for this project:<br>
                <span style="background-color: gold;">Note: this isn't an "offical" changelog</span>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Version</th><th>Item</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>v1.0.0</td>
                        <td>First release</td>
                        <td>I am surprised that I do not have some v0.x release.<br>
                            Anyways, it was released on April fools (which I did not considered during releasing this), so I released v1.2.0 pretty soon to avoid confusion for april fools jokes<br>
                            (Unrelated but I just wanted to talk about Stack overflow's April fools joke is fantastic)
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>v1.2.0</td>
                        <td>Seeds, level groups and new UI</td>
                        <td>
                            I am impressed that I can work for that many features in a few days.<br>
                            Especially the new generator page. The old one took long enough to develop, and it is hard to decided that it needs a new one in a short period of time.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>v1.2.2</td>
                        <td>Block Variants</td>
                        <td>The release of this version means that I can read most of the content in the NSMBW arc level files.<br>Also fixed the Thwomp "Crush Forever" bug, which was caused by another oversight.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>v1.2.3</td>
                        <td>Enemy Variants</td>
                        <td>I am kind of not satisfied with how the "Enemy Variants" work in the configuration file, but it was the best approach I have came up with (at least at the moment).<br>
                        (I mean that currently you have to know the raw data, which can be inconvenient at times.)</td>
                    </tr>
