                A New Super Mario Bros. Wii Randomizer that can randomize enemies, levels and more!
            </p>
            <h1>The inspiration</h1>
            <p>
                When I first disovered the <a href="https://authorblues.github.io/smwrandomizer/">Super Mario World Randomizer</a>, I always
                though that was pretty cool concept.
                The randomizer offers a different enought experiece for players to experience the game again, and to me,
                this is what I value for a game.
                <br>
                Fast-forward to today, a lot of games still doesn't have a flesh-out randomizer, including one of my childhood game,
                New Super Mario Bros Wii. There are a level randomizer (which randomize the files), but not all the other things. Therefore,
                I decided to take on this project for 1, me, and 2, for other NSMBW fans.<br>
                Although I missed the "golden era" of NSMBW (Mainly because I fully understand the modding scene only a few years back, like 2017), I still wish to work on
                this project to increase my experience in programming (This is one of my first actual "big" project since I learnt programming) and
                also gain knowledge in game modding.

            <h1>How I started</h1>
            <p>
                At the time I was already familar with Wii modding scene enough to know for how this project will be going.
                Here is a list of them:
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Item</th><th>Item used</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Programming language</td>
                        <td>Python</td>
                        <td>Can we just talk about how much more convenient Python is, compared to something like Java and C?</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="bottomNav" style="width:95%">
            <script src="https://hbrohei.github.io/Nav/bottom.js"></script>
        </div>
